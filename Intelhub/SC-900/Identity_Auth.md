- Digital Colaboration has changed. Your employees and partners now need to
- collaborate and access organizational resources from anywhere, any device.
- There's also been a growth of people working from home.

- Enterprise Security needs to adapt.
- The security perimeter can no longer be seen as on-premises network
- It extends to:
  - SaaS applications for business-critical workloads that might be hosted outside the company network.
  - Employees have started using private devices to connect to corperate networks. (BYOD, Bring Your Own Device) From home or on the go.
  - Unmanaged devices useed by partners or costumers when interacting with corperate data or collaborating with employees.
  - IoT devices (Internet of Things) installed throughout the corperate network and inside costumer locations.
 
- Identity has become the new security perimeter that enables organizations to secure their assets.
- An identity may be associated with:
  - a user
  - an application
  - a device
  - something else
 
- Four pillars of identity infrastructure:
  - **Administration**
    - Administration is about the creation and management/governance of identities for users, devices and services.
  - **Authentication**
    - Tells the story of how much an IT system needs to know about an identity to have enough proof about who you are.
  - **Authorization**
    - About processing the incoming identity data to determine the level of access you can have.
  - **Auditing**
    - About tracking who does what, when, where and how.
