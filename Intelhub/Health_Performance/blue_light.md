# 🛡️ Blue Light Glasses — Intel Brief for IT Professionals

## 🎯 Mission Context
As an IT pro, prolonged screen time under artificial lighting leads to:
- Eye strain
- Cognitive fatigue
- Melatonin suppression
- Poor sleep recovery

## 🔬 Scientific Findings

| ✅ Benefit | 🧠 Summary |
|-----------|-----------|
| 👁️ Eye Strain Reduction | Filters scatter-heavy wavelengths (400–470nm) that tire ciliary muscles. |
| 😴 Sleep Improvement | Blocks circadian-disruptive light to restore melatonin levels (especially at night). |
| 🧠 Focus Support | Reduces glare and light fatigue = better code review, problem-solving, multitasking. |
| ⚠️ Retinal Protection (Inconclusive) | Lab evidence suggests high exposure *may* cause long-term stress—more relevant to LED overexposure. |

## 🧰 Recommended Usage (IT Workflows)

### ☀️ **Daytime (Work/Study)**
- Use clear or mild yellow-tinted lenses.
- Aim for 20–40% blue light filtering (455 nm range).
- Works well for:
  - Coding / Terminal Ops
  - Monitoring / SIEM dashboards
  - Long support sessions

### 🌙 **Night (Late Ops / Learning)**
- Switch to amber/red lenses (90–100% blocking).
- Stack with:
  - `Night Light` (Windows)
  - `Redshift` or `f.lux` (Linux)
  - Dark terminal themes
