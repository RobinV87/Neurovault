## 📜 Mission Purpose  
**Side Missions** are tactical, low-profile operations designed to sharpen ARCANA.NODE’s capabilities without disrupting primary workflow.  
They are stealth deployments—executed during regular workdays to gather intel, map systems, and build cybersecurity instincts from within the shadows of Cloud Een.

These missions support the long-term evolution from Blue to Purple Team operator.
