## 🧪 Debrief  
- What did you learn about Cloud Een’s security maturity?
  - There is a start, but it has a long way to go, I want to be on the forefront of it.
- Are there any weak spots or opportunities to improve visibility or awareness?
  - Because of people working from home we can't dissalow all devices, it's a Bring Your Own Stuff place.
  - And what is being provided by the boss is not one brand.
- How can this knowledge support your future Purple Team efforts?
  - I can make my defend and attack plans from that, rubber duckies go through all security if done through non admin ways.
